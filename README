# Knowledge

I. HTML

1. Difference between <button> and <input type="button" />
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/469059/button-vs-input-type-button-which-to-use

Conclusion : Nên sử dụng input button
<button> có default behavior là submit khi click

2. Tab
<ul> <li> is better than button for creating tab 

3. Inline & Block elements 
・　Inline : within one line, without breaking into a new line
    <a> .... 
・　Block  : take up the full width available
　　<p>, <div> ....

4. Canvas 
Used to draw graphics on a web page using Javascript.

II. Javascript

$document.ready() is used to make sure that the page is fully loaded before running any Javascript code.
→　Prevent errors caused by trying to manipulate elements that have not yet been loaded.

III. CSS

Shorthand style writing 
Margin : space around element


IV. Tips

1. Key shortcut
Alt + Arrow             : mutate an entire line up or down
Shift + Alt + ↑ OR ↓    : copy a row up or down 

2. Link with github
Github.io requires main index file being named as index.html
